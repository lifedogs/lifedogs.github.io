        <description>can dogs eat spinach?.The digestive system of the dog is set up for eating meat, and that makes a big difference. They often swallow their food in large bites and their stomach capacity is larger than ours. Food stays in the dog’s. Some dogs are extremely susceptible to grape and raisin poisoning while others can eat them with no problem—something else that confounds experts. Dogs teeth are made for tearing into their food.</description>

        <description>can dogs have chicken broth with onion.This post may contain affiliate links. Aug 19, 2009 · hi danielle, i have been making chicken bone broth and feed this to my 3 dogs every night with meals that i cook for them. Will the liquid broth hurt my dogs? I even saw this great idea on the kitchn for using ice cube trays to freeze individuals portions. Do not feed your dog meat sauces (any food really) that have high levels of sodium.</description>
